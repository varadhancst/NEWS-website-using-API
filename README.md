NEWS website using API

This website works with help of news API

I developed a website using Python and the Flask web framework that retrieves the latest news from around the world through an API and displays them on the website based on a keyword entered by the user. The website also includes a contact form that allows users to send messages to the website owner and receives responses via SMTP mail configuration. The website uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the client-side implementation and implements server-side logic using Python and the Flask framework. This project demonstrates my ability to design and implement a full-stack web application using modern technologies and good coding practices.
